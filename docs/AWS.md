# Introduction to  aws
Cloud Computing-
 - delivery of computing services by creating virtual servers over internet.

DataCenter -
Ex: Airtel.
At a time, millions of calls.
to do all those of jobs to connect, disconnect calls, data services you need of computing.

After Cloud Computing came in, companies need not maintain data center. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) run these data centers, which are given as a service to Companies like Airtel, OLA, Swiggy. 

Cloud Providers -

AWS (Amzon Web Services)
Azure (Microsoft)
GCP (Google)

Private DataCenter -
Security - Banks.
They want to move, not moved yet.

---------------------------------
Iaas - Infra as a service
Paas - Platform as a service
Saas - Software as a service

Ex - Email service (gmail)

to host a gmail service- servers, storage, network
Gmail - Saas (providing software)
AWS, Azure or GCP - Iaas (providing infra)
IBM Bluemix - Paas (.NET platform)

--------------------------------
Region and Availability Zone

31 Regions, 99 AZs.

Regions - Mumbai and Hyderabad
for Disaster Recovery purpose.
Mumbai -3 different locaitons. we call them Availbility Zones.
Mumbai -ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b-ap-south-1c
Min 2 Azs and max upto 6Azs.

How many Az's does Hyderbad(ap-south-2) have -3
How many AZ's does North Virginia(us-east-1) have -6 

--------------------------------
Amazon Web Services

Established - 2006
highly reliable, scalable and low cost infra in the cloud.

Iaas - Infra as a service. Ex: AWS, Azure, GCP
They give compute, memory and storage. you use this to create an instance and deploy you webapp.

Paas - Platform as a service
Ex: SalesForce, SAP 

Saas - Software as a service
Ex: Gmail, Dropbox
Gmail - 
you are not spinning up infra
you are not installing any email software

Benefits of Cloud Computing-
1. Low Cost - 10/- rs per hour. i'll give a system with cpu, memory and storage.
Laptop - 40-50k rupees

2. Elasticity and Agility - 
Ex: OLA. 
normal time - 100%
peak 9-11am or 6-8pm - 140%
non-peak 10pm-5am. 40% capacity

3. Open and Flexible
Ex: Operating System licensing issues.

4. Secure
Ex: Same security for everyone using.

5. Global Reach
within minutes i can deploy it globally.
